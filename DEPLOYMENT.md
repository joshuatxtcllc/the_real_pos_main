# Jay's Frames POS System - Deployment Guide

## Deployment Fixes Applied

### ✅ Critical Issues Resolved

1. **ES Module Compatibility**
   - Fixed `__dirname is not defined` error by adding proper polyfills
   - Updated server/index.ts with `fileURLToPath` and `dirname` imports
   - Added ES module compatibility for production builds

2. **Server Architecture**
   - Removed orphaned error handler in routes.ts that was causing app undefined error
   - Improved error handling with graceful shutdown procedures
   - Added fallback port handling for deployment conflicts

3. **Production Configuration**
   - Enhanced port binding with REPL_PORT fallback support
   - Added comprehensive error handling for startup failures
   - Implemented graceful shutdown handlers for SIGTERM/SIGINT

4. **Service Initialization**
   - Added error handling for Discord bot initialization
   - Made notification service optional to prevent startup failures
   - Improved logging and error reporting

## Deployment Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Alternative Production Start
```bash
node start.mjs
```

## Environment Variables Required

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (already configured)
- `PORT` - Server port (defaults to 5000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to 'production' for deployment

## Deployment Verification

The application has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Server starts without crashes
- ✅ Port binding works correctly (5000 with fallback)
- ✅ API endpoints respond successfully
- ✅ Database connections established
- ✅ Error handling prevents crash loops
- ✅ ES module compatibility resolved

## Current Status

**Ready for deployment** - All critical deployment issues have been resolved.

The server is running successfully on port 5000 and responding to API requests. The application can now be deployed to Replit's deployment infrastructure without the previous errors.
