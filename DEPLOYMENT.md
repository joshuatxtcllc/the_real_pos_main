# Deployment Instructions

The deployment issues have been resolved with the following fixes:

## Applied Fixes:

1. **ES Module Configuration**: Created proper ES module build configuration
2. **Script Type Fix**: Fixed HTML script type="module" attribute issue
3. **Build Process**: Updated build to use ESM format instead of CommonJS

## To deploy:

1. Run the production build:
   ```bash
   node build-production.mjs
   ```

2. The built application will be in the `dist/` directory with:
   - Frontend assets in `dist/public/`
   - Server as `dist/index.mjs`
   - Proper `package.json` with ES module configuration

3. Deploy the `dist/` directory contents

## Key Changes Made:

- Changed esbuild output from CommonJS to ES modules (`format: 'esm'`)
- Fixed HTML script references to include `type="module"`
- Created production package.json with `"type": "module"`
- Ensured proper import.meta handling for deployment

The application now properly supports ES modules throughout the build pipeline.
