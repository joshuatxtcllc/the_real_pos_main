# Database Connection & Cart Functionality Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved:

✓ **Database Connection Working**: Emergency test confirmed 11 orders with real customer data
✓ **Cart Functionality Updated**: Button now reads "Save Order (No Payment Required)"
✓ **Order Creation Fixed**: Orders save with status="pending" without requiring payment
✓ **Production Build Working**: 3576 modules transformed, 216.2kb server bundle created

## Root Cause Found:
The production server was using a development configuration that didn't properly connect to the database, despite the database containing real orders from customers like Joshua Stevens, Brittney Locke, and Rick.

## Current Status:
- Database: ✓ Working (11 orders confirmed)
- Frontend: ✓ Building successfully 
- Server: ✓ Fixed configuration with proper database connection
- Cart: ✓ Orders can be saved without payment requirement
- API: ✓ Ready to serve real order data

Your POS system is now fully operational for saving orders without requiring payment at creation time.
